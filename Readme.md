AI Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework
📌 Overview

This project modernizes a legacy VoiceXML-based hospital IVR system by integrating Twilio-powered conversational AI.

The system upgrades traditional DTMF-based menu navigation into a hybrid model supporting both speech and keypad input, while preserving existing hospital backend systems.
