# AI Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

## Overview
This project modernizes a legacy VoiceXML-based hospital IVR system by integrating Twilio-powered conversational AI.

The upgraded system supports both speech and DTMF input while preserving existing hospital backend systems.

## Existing System
- VoiceXML-based IVR
- Menu-driven call flow
- DTMF-only interaction
- Static error handling

## Modernized Architecture
- Twilio integration layer
- Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Intent detection
- Intelligent routing
- Fallback to legacy IVR

## Key Features
- Hybrid interaction (Speech + DTMF)
- API-based backend integration
- Session management
- Real-time processing
- Graceful fallback mechanism

## Goal
Enhance patient experience with AI-driven voice interaction while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure.
